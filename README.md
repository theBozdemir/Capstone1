This website allows a way to seed Spotify's recommendation algortihm in an easy-to-use GUI. There are two routes into the search: one is an application level, server side login; and the second is a user login on Spotify's servers which allows for the ability to save resultant playlists to the user's Spotify account. We have no affiliation with Spotify but very much appreciate their API access and industry-leading musical algorithms.
